libMidi: An implementation of the MIDI protocol for the MSP430
===============================================================

This is a GPL licensed implementation of MIDI for use with the MSP430 series
microcontrollers. It is written to work both as a master and a slave. The
hardware implementation should use the USI/USCI pins on the microcontroller
via an optoisolator.


Implementing
------------

To use libMidi with your MSP430 project, first build the library using the
included makefile. Remember to define the microcontroller you are using on
the command line if it is not currently hooked up to your computer:

  $ export MCU=msp430g2553
  $ make
  
Or as a one-liner:

  $ MCU=msp430g2553 make

When you have the library compiled, copy it into your project folder if needed
and pass it on the command line to the compiler, preferably by adding it to
your projects makefile.


Interrupts
----------

If you aren't doing anything else with your interrupts, you can safely use the
interrupt stubs defined in midi.h in your code:

  #include "midi.h"
  USCI_HANDLER; // Or USI_HANDLER


Initialization
--------------

To initialize the library, call the init method like so:

  midi_init(MIDI_MODE_USCI, &rcvmidi);

If parameter 2 is set to null no callback will be used.
